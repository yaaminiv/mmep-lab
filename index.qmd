With climate change rapidly impacting ecosystems, phenotypic plasticity that operates on timescales quicker than evolutionary adaptation is crucial for species persistence. We investigate marine invertebrate resilience to climate change by interrogating phenotypic plasticity. We want to know how and why plasticity is observed, and how a plastic response at one level of biological hierarchy is connected to other physiological responses. To do this, we integrate molecular biology (ex. genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, lipidomics) and physiological techniques to elucidate mechanisms that underlie our observations.
