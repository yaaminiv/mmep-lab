# Join the lab!

I am not recruiting any students during Fall 2025. If you are eligible to take upper-division courses and are interested in the marine biology, physiology, and/or molecular biology, please take Project Lab (BIOL 191) Winter 2026! If you cannot take BIOL 191, [email me]() to discuss potential student opportunities.

There are several university fellowships for students who want to conduct research in the summer. If you'd like to do research in MMEP Lab this summer, please email Dr. Venkataraman by January 15, 2026.
