she/her

I am a microbial ecologists devoted to figuring out what all the weird marine microeukaryotes are doing in the ocean. Our work combines field expeditions, wet-lab experiments, molecular methods, and computational biology to ask address questions about the ecological roles microorganisms play in the ecosystem.

I'm most excited about research in the deep-sea, especially biologically rich habitats like hydrothermal vents. I love teaching and mentoring about all things biological oceanography, coding, and more! This lab is built on a shared love for the natural world.

#### Alexis Adams

##### **PhD student**

My name is Alexis and I am a PhD student here at Texas A&M! With a passion for understanding how ecological interactions impact the world around us I have dedicated myself to studying unicellular eukaryotes and their important role within the deep ocean. When I'm not working you can find me reading or playing my piano. I believe science should be a safe space for all and I am excited to explore the fascinating world of microbes!

#### Kayla Nedd

##### **PhD student**

knedd \[at\] tamu.edu\
she/her

My name is Kayla Nedd. I joined the Hu lab in the summer of 2023 as a PhD student. My research interests are microbial ecology in extreme environments. I would like to understand what allows these microbes to be so well equipped to handle the intense conditions of the deep sea. Last summer, I participated in my first research cruise to Axial Seamount, an underwater volcano, to study protists in deep sea hydrothermal vents. I am thrilled to delve further into my research and better understand this truly magnificent aspect of our planet.

#### Abby Day

##### **Undergraduate Research Assistant**

she/her

Abby is an Environmental Geoscience major minoring in Anthropology and GIST. She is extremely interested in the world around us, both the past and what is currently going on today. As an Environmental Geoscience major minoring in Anthropology, she hopes to pursue a career that can combine both of these fields. In the past, Abby did research on microorganisms and what their distribution in the water column could tell us about past climates. That study has continued to pique her interest and she is pursing similar work in the Hu lab.

#### Madeleine Lerma

##### **Undergraduate Research Assistant**

she/her

Madeleine is a Zoology major and ECCB minor from Corpus Christi, Texas. After graduating from Texas A&M University, she hopes to attend graduate school to become a marine biologist and pursue a career in research. She is undecided about the specialty she may choose, but is passionate about marine ecosystems. In her free time, she enjoys reading, listening to music, and exploring nature.

#### Siddarth Seshampally

##### **Undergraduate Research Assistant**

Siddharth is a freshman at Texas A&M University, class of 2027, majoring in Oceanography. Playing football (not American football) has been a passion of his and he hopes to play for the A&M team soon. Siddarth has a deep curiosity for the mysteries of the ocean, and his goal is to contribute to the progress of this field. Eager to explore the wonders of marine science and dedicated to making a positive impact, he looks forward to the exciting journey that lies ahead.
