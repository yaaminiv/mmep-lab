# Science becomes more equitable when information is accessible to all.

**All members of the MMEP Lab are required to keep open-access lab notebooks online**. These lab notebooks act as resources for ourselves and others. We encourage the use of lab notebooks to document methodological processes, roadblocks, troubleshooting, half-baked ideas, and fresh results.
